Frontend: Built with React (Vite/CRA), input for domain name, and display for JSON WHOIS data.
Backend: Node.js + Express that securely proxies requests to the Whois XML API.
Security: API key is stored in .env and never exposed to the frontend.
Deployment: Localhost for dev; easy to deploy to Render, Vercel, or Heroku.
